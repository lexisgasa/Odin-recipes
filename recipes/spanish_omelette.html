    <p>Spanish omelette is a traditional dish from Spain. Celebrated as national dish by Spaniards, it is an essential part of the Spanish cuisine.[3] It is an omelette made with eggs and potatoes, optionally including onion. It is often served at room temperature as a tapa.</p>
    <p>It is commonly known in Spanish-speaking countries as tortilla de patatas, tortilla de papas, tortilla española.</p>

    <ul><u>Ingredients:</u>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><u>Steps:</u>
        <li>Start by adding your sliced potatoes to hot olive oil in a heavy pan. They need to be fully covered in the oil — so you’ll need to use quite a bit! Don’t worry, you can reuse it a few times, so it won’t go to waste. Cook the potatoes over a medium heat, remember that you don’t want french fries!</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, add the sliced onions to a separate pan with a bit of olive oil. Sauté these over a medium heat until starting to caramelize (about 15-20 minutes). Add a splash of water if needed from time to time so that they don’t burn</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are fully cooked some may start to break apart. That’s okay, but don’t let them become too broken down.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the onions so that they don’t burn.</li>

        <li> In a large bowl, beat your eggs (which should be at room temperature). Add the cooked onion and mix. </li>
        <li>Next, you need to drain the potatoes in a large colander (save the excess olive oil for another recipe!). Once the potatoes have cooled slightly (about five minutes or so) gently stir them into the onion and egg mixture. Be careful that the hot potatoes don’t start to scramble the egg.</li>
           <br>
            <ul>Pro tip:
                <li>Season with salt (many people taste the raw tortilla batter to adjust for salt, but if you prefer not to just add a couple of teaspoons for now). Now let this mixture sit for 15 minutes (I know it’s tempting to just go ahead and make the tortilla — but trust me!).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li>Gently pour the tortilla batter into a frying pan over medium-low heat. You don’t want the pan to be too hot. Gently cook the tortilla for about six to eight minutes on the first side. You can run a spatula along the sides to make sure it’s not sticking.</li>
        <li>To flip the tortilla grab a large plate — it must be larger than the frying pan! See my note below about the two tortilla trick to make this easier. Put the plate on top of the pan and flip quickly and confidently. It will be runny, but don’t worry — you’ll put everything back into the pan to cook the other side!</li>

        <li>Slide the tortilla back into the frying pan and let the other side cook for another six to eight minutes (let it cook longer if you like your tortilla fully cooked through). Then flip back out onto a clean plate. Allow it to cool for at least ten minutes before slicing and enjoying. </li>

        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Take your time. The best tortillas aren’t quick, 15 minute affairs. But they’re worth the extra effort. </li>
            <li>Lower the heat. The first time I cooked tortilla I had the heat too high, similar to when making other egg dishes. This resulted in a rubbery tortilla.</li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes and onions separately. Many recipes cook them together, but to get each to its prime Spanish omelette point, I think it’s worth washing one more pan.</li>
            <li>Use room temperature eggs. In Europe, many people don’t refrigerate their eggs at all. Recipes are meant to use room temperature eggs and it does make a big difference.</li>
            <li>Let the egg, potato, and onion mixture sit for at least 15 minutes — minimum! This makes a HUGE difference to the final result. It is a must.</li>
            <li>Don’t fear the flip! You have to go forcefully and quickly to make it happen. Don’t be afraid!</li>
            <li>Use a small frying pan and make two tortillas when starting out. I love this tip because it makes the flip so much easier (the pan is lighter, any dinner plate will work, and if you mess up the first time you still have half the batter left!).  </li>
            <li>Use great quality olive oil. Considering the potatoes are slowly cooked in olive oil, they absorb a lot of it. If you use good quality olive oil everything will be tastier and much healthier too.             </li>
        </ul>
